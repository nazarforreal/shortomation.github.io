One day a little while ago I was in the process of creating a new shortcut and a thought jumped immediately into my mind: "What if I automate the process of json request creation instead of laying it out every time I wanted to create a new page with some properties prefilled".

I immediately began to develop a "Notion JSON Request Builder" shortcut. As for me, this one was revolutional because not only it turned out to be very simple and efficient, it was also a shortcuts just like any other shortcut I created previously. And, thanks to the *Run Shortcut* action I could run some the reusable shortcuts from the editor of other shortcuts. 

Moreover, you can pass the output of one reusable shortcut to another creating a reusable sequence.
